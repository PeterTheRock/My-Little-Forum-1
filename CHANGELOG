bugfixes in comparision to 1.7.6
................................

- If a new user registers with a not completely filled form, the following test for empty strings in the given data failed because the variables do not exists.
- Send the PHP generated HTTP header 'Location' with a complete URI instead a relative URL.
- Fields for IPs in database tables have now a length of 39 to match the length of the string representation of an IP-v6-address.
- Replace the use of $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] with $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] due to security reasons.
- Use htmlspecialchars instead stripslashes while generating the HTML sources.
- Disable magic_quotes script wise if it is an active server setting.
- Some HTML elements was generated even if there was no data (like a homepage-URL) or reason (a user should not edit a posting (after x minutes), the link to do so was accessible continious).
- Use '&amp;' instead of '&' in HTML sources to match the HTML validation rules.
- BB-Code buttons now will be generated through JacaScript. No JavaScript, no (in this case unusual) buttons.
- Mask strings in database requests with mysql_real_escape_string.
- Integers from variables in database requests are safe because the use of intval (if given in wrong format => value: 0).
- Use 'rel="nofollow"' in intern links to prevent access to some scripts for search engine robots (i.e. data of registered users, posting- and contact forms).
- If a thread is in board view shown on more than one page, a poster was redirected to the first page instead the last page (where his posting is located) after a reply.
- Delete control characters from the output of XML (i.e. RSS, causing parse errors).
